# first-reconnaissance-on-pyeem
This is an activity that was done in class to get some practical knowledge on reconnaissance activity. I have used Maltego in Kali
I have used many different transforms to run on this website to get copious amount of data but I am not yet able to create sound information based on the data gathered.
Next objective would be to try to understand what type of information is meaningful so and how to get that information from the data gathered.
